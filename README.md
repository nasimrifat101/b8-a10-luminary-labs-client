Dear Sir,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and give you a heads-up about a little hiccup I ran into. I've been having some trouble accessing our GitHubClass repository due to pesky network issues. As a result, I've had a bit of a struggle pushing my work on private Github class repository.

I tried reaching out during a support session and even dropped a post on the Programming Hero Facebook page. The instructor suggested pushing my code to my personal GitHub profile as a workaround.

Just wanted to keep you in the loop. Thanks a bunch for your understanding.

Best regards,
